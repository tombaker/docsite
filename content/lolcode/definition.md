A function is demarked with the opening keyword `HOW IZ I` and the closing keyword `IF U SAY SO`. The syntax is as follows:

``` html
HOW IZ I <function name> [YR <argument1> [AN YR <argument2> â€¦]]
  <code block>
IF U SAY SO
```

Currently, the number of arguments in a function can only be defined as a fixed number. The `<argument>`s are single-word identifiers that act as variables within the scope of the function's code. The calling parameters' values are then the initial values for the variables within the function's code block when the function is called.

_Currently, functions do not have access to the outer/calling code block's variables._
