An indefinite number of YARNs may be explicitly concatenated with the `SMOOSH...MKAY` operator. Arguments may optionally be separated with `AN`. As the `SMOOSH` expects strings as its input arguments, it will implicitly cast all input values of other types to YARNs. The line ending may safely implicitly close the `SMOOSH` operator without needing an `MKAY`.
