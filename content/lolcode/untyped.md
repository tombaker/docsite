The untyped type (NOOB) cannot be implicitly cast into any type except a TROOF. A cast into TROOF makes the variable FAIL. Any operations on a NOOB that assume another type (e.g., math) results in an error.

Explicit casts of a NOOB (untyped, uninitialized) variable are to empty/zero values for all other types.
