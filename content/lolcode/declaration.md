_(modified from 1.1)_

To declare a variable, the keyword is `I HAS A` followed by the variable name. To assign the variable a value within the same statement, you can then follow the variable name with `ITZ <value>`.

Assignment of a variable is accomplished with an assignment statement, `<variable> R <expression>`

``` ruby
I HAS A VAR            BTW VAR is null and untyped
VAR R "THREE"          BTW VAR is now a YARN and equals "THREE"
VAR R 3                BTW VAR is now a NUMBR and equals 3
```
